# Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction Project

## Project Overview

The "Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction" project aims to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application. The predictive model will estimate the resale prices of flats in Singapore based on historical data of resale flat transactions.

## Project Objectives

- **Skills Developed:**
  - Data Wrangling
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Model Building
  - Model Deployment

- **Domain:**
  - Real Estate

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of flats in Singapore. The competitive resale flat market makes it challenging to accurately predict prices, considering factors like location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration. A machine learning model will be developed and deployed to provide users with estimated resale prices based on these factors.

## Motivation

The resale flat market in Singapore is highly competitive, and accurate price estimation is crucial. This project aims to leverage machine learning to overcome challenges in estimating resale values, providing users with informed predictions based on historical transaction data.

## Scope

The project includes the following tasks:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Collect dataset from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for resale flat transactions (1990 to Till Date).
   - Preprocess data for cleaning and structuring.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Extract relevant features from the dataset.
   - Create additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.

3. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - Choose a regression model (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or random forests).
   - Train the model using historical data.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate model performance using regression metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2 Score).

5. **Streamlit Web Application:**
   - Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit.
   - Utilize the trained model for price predictions based on user inputs.

6. **Deployment on Render:**
   - Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platform for internet accessibility.

7. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Thoroughly test the deployed application for functionality and accuracy.

## Deliverables

1. A well-trained machine learning model for resale price prediction.
2. A user-friendly web application (built with Streamlit/Flask/Django) deployed on the Render platform/Any Cloud Platform.
3. Documentation and instructions for using the application.
4. A project report summarizing data analysis, model development, and deployment.

## Results

The project benefits potential buyers and sellers in the Singapore housing market, providing an informed estimate of resale prices. The practical application of machine learning in real estate and web development is demonstrated.
